  A proof of concept of a survey project which improved my Flutter skills. It contains login, homepage, show lists and detail of places fetched from API (Express.js,Node.js). I use LINE SDK for login and did a release version on Firebase App Distribution.

   - `JSON and serialization`
   - Convert base64 image from API to bytesImage with Uint8List 
   - Google Fonts
   - Flutter Native Splash screen
   - Networking & Http
